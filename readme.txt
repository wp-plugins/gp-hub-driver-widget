Display your favourite current F1 driver in your sidebar with in-season stats updated

== Description ==

GP Hub records detailed stats as F1 season progresses we've some up into a simple widget so you can show your support for your favourite driver throughout the season. 

Select your driver from this season's lineup and it'll display their wins, points, position as well as their team and driver number. 

It's a responsive display so it should fit most website sidebars. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload `gphub-driver-widget.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Admin > Appearance > Widgets and add the 'GP Hub: Driver Widget' to your sidebar of choice. 
4. Select a driver and set the click through if you want to link to the detailed stats page on GP Hub

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I pick a reserve driver? =

Not yet, but if you're really keen to show one, get in touch and I'll see what I can do. 

= Can I show other drivers from other Series =

Not yet, but GP Hub covers Indycar, GP2, GP3, FR3.5 and Formule 3 so if you're keen for someone from there I'll develop the plugin further.
