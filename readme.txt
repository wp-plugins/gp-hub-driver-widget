F1, Indy, Formula E championship widgets.

== Description ==

This plugin includes two widgets:

Widget 1: Series Overview. The includes the drivers & teams standings and the upcoming races.
Widget 2: Driver (F1 Only). Shows the latest stats for a driver from the F1 series.

GP Hub follows the top level open-wheel series and their junior series.  We've bundled this up into a simple widget so you can show your support for your favourite driver throughout the season or compliment your blog with the series data in real time. 

Select your driver from this season's lineup and it'll display their wins, points, position as well as their team and driver number. 

It's a responsive display so it should fit most website sidebars. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload `gphub-driver-widget.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Admin > Appearance > Widgets and add the 'GP Hub: Driver Widget' to your sidebar of choice. 
4. Select a driver and set the click through if you want to link to the detailed stats page on GP Hub

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What series does it cover? = 

The standings widget can be set to show F1, Formula E, Indycar, Indy Lights, GP2, GP3, Formula Renault 3.5 or Formula 3 Euro
Currently the driver widget only shows F1 drivers. 

= The Standings box isn't showing the whole standings =

Enable the clickthrough to GP Hub and it'll include a 'show more' button to drop down the full standings/calendar

= How often does it update? =
For major series such as F1, Formula E or Indycar the results are within an hour. For other series it's usually the same day as the race.

= Can I show other drivers from other Series =

Not yet, but GP Hub covers Indycar, GP2, GP3, FR3.5 and Formula 3 so if you're keen for someone from there I'll develop the plugin further.
